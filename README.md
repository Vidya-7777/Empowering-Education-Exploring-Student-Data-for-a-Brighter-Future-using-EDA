# Empowering-Education-Exploring-Student-Data-for-a-Brighter-Future-using-EDA

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze student performance data to identify key factors influencing academic success. By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we uncover patterns related to school type, gender, study habits, absences, and grades. These insights can help drive impactful changes in education systems, policies, and learning strategies.

## Alignment with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education

**SDG Goal 4**: _Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all._

This EDA project directly supports SDG 4 by:
- Identifying gaps in education quality and accessibility across student groups.
- Promoting early interventions based on trends in attendance, age, and performance.
- Enabling data-driven decision-making to improve educational systems.
- Highlighting the influence of parental support and lifestyle on learning outcomes.

**Graphical**:
- Stacked Bar Charts
- Scatter Plots
- Line Charts
- Area Graphs
- Correlation Heatmaps

## Project Impact

- **Educational Inclusivity**: Reveals if students of varying ages and backgrounds are receiving equal educational opportunities.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Helps educators recognize early warning signs like absenteeism or low G1 scores.
- **Gender Equity Analysis**: Compares performance and access between genders, supporting both SDG 4 and SDG 5.
- **Data-Driven Planning**: Encourages institutions to utilize analytics in designing better curricula, support programs, and resource allocation.
